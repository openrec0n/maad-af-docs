# Design

MAAD-AF is developed natively in [PowerShell 5.1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-5.1) and leverages PowerShell modules to interact with various Microsoft cloud services. All MAAD-AF attack modules are open-source and modular by design making it easy to review, add, deprecate or update them for anyone.
