# Requirements

MAAD-AF requriements are minimal to enable quick setup: 

1. Windows host with PowerShell 5 and local host permissions to run un-signed scripts (any Windows host, can be a Virtual Machine too)
2. Internet connection
3. Entra ID (Azure AD) credentials for security testing (used to execute attacks)


> Note: MAAD-AF does require certain [standard powershell modules](../MAAD Attack Framework/PowerShell Modules.md) that it gathers automatically at launch.
